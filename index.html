							<h2>Amelo Is Different</h2>
							<p>Amelo has an ambition to change the way software is developed and priced. There’s a clear process that gives customers peace of mind that, with Amelo, you will get results fast, with flexibility and freedom.</p>

								<h3>Flexibility built in</h3>
								<p>
									We embrace change, and accept that while you’ll often start with a goal in mind, even the best thought-through plans may need to change. That’s why our developers focus on responding to change and giving you working software, instead of rigidly following an out-of-date plan.
								</p>
								<p>
									Flexibility is at the core of our software development process, with just enough planning for fast implementation. With Amelo you can always change software features as we go along, so you get exactly what you need. 
								</p>

							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-chart-area accent3"></span>
								<h3>Feedback throughout</h3>
								<p>We immerse ourselves in your business, by inviting an expert from your business to become part of our team. An assembly line manager who shared his experience enabled us to halve the time spent developing a model of the bottling plant. We supported the business need and helped his employer, a major manufacturer, gain a competitive edge.</p>
								<p>Your appointed expert becomes our direct point of contact for questions and feedback. In this way - the agile way - you can ask for as many changes as you like, as often as you like. </p>

								<h3>Development in the open</h3>
								<p>At any time you can look at what’s going on - and see the project taking shape. We test and review as we go along, and fix anything you don’t like.</p>

								<h3>Satisfaction guaranteed </h3>
								<p>We delivery early and often so you can see if what we’ve built suits your needs. If it doesn’t, you can walk away. But we’re confident you won’t, because our way of developing software is more successful.  </p>

								<h3>The Agile Way</h3>
								<ul style="text-align: left;">
									<li>You get full visibility of the development process.</li>								
									<li>You know exactly what you are getting and when.</li>
									<li>You get regular releases with new features – new versions of the software are constantly available to users.</li>
									<li>You are able to provide feedback quickly for immediate response.</li>
									<li>You get to shape the direction of the product with closer collaboration between developers and the business.</li>
									<li>You can make changes at any point – even late in development.</li>
									<li>You can make improvements while your existing systems are live, with no disruption to the business.</li>
									<li>You don’t have to wait until the end to see the value to your business.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Traditional way</h3>
								<ul style="text-align: left;">
									<li>You get full visibility of the development process.</li>
									<li>You must wait until the end to see the product.</li>
									<li>You need to make formal requests for any changes.</li>
									<li>Each of your changes leads to a change to the contract.</li>
									<li>You spend time negotiating a detailed plan of attack, rather than getting started.</li>
									<li>You don’t realise you are behind schedule until you reach the end.</li>
									<li>You get as little as possible interaction with the developers with less chance they’re building the right thing or understand business requirements.</li>
									<li>You don’t get a return on investment until the very end of the project.</li>
									<li>You may not know what you want until you see it, and by that time, it’ll be too late.</li>
